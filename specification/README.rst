==================
openinput Protocol
==================

The openinput protocol aims to provide a way to configure common properties of
input devices, including, but not limited to, lighting, keybindings/macros,
sensor resolutions (DPI/CPI)... It was designed on top of the USB HID protocol,
which itself can be transported over USB, Bluetooth, I2C, SMBus, etc.
